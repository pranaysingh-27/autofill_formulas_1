# autofill_formulas_1
GOOGLE APP SCRIPT (Sheets): Enter formulas in required cells automatically. (Code for repetitive task).

Explanation of the code:

> Function Definition: The function `autofill_formulas_1()` is designed to autofill formulas into specific cells in a Google Spreadsheet.

> Active Spreadsheet and Sheet Selection:  
 - The function gets the active spreadsheet and selects the sheet named `'black_friday'`.

> Outer Loop (20 iterations):  
 - The loop runs 20 times, starting with row 51 and increments by 7 for each iteration (`targetRow`).
 - A corresponding source row starts at row 44 and increments by 6 for each iteration (`sourceRow`).

> Inner Loop (Columns D to I):  
 - A second loop iterates over columns D to I (columns 4 to 9).

> Formula Creation:  
 - For each column, a formula is generated by referencing columns U to Z (columns 21 to 26) in the first row.
 - The formula uses the `getRange()` method to get the cell reference for the corresponding column, and the `replace()` method removes the row number from the reference, so only the column letter is used.

> Formula Application:  
 - The formula is then applied to the target cell at `targetRow` and `col`.

> Outcome:  
 - This process autofills formulas in cells from row 51 onward, applying them in columns D to I, with references based on columns U to Z.
